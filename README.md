so a hub for the games that I develop to practice Python skills

## 1. Guess the number
### You can choose between the two options:

1. You're guessing the number generated by the program based on the hints

2. Program is guessing the number based on your hints



## 2. Rock, paper, scissors
For every round the computer makes a pre-choice, it let's you make your choice and compares the results
You can choose between the game modes:
Best of 3
Best of 5
Best of 10



## 3. Hangman
You choose the length of a word and have 8 attempts to guess it. Program chooses a random word of that length from the dictionary.
Each incorrect guess updates the picture of a hangman.
